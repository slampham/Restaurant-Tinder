For this project, we decided to use tinder-style rules over tournament style. There are two rounds in total, so if none of the restaurants had 100% right swipes, then the one with the most votes will be chosen at the end of the second round. Note that swipes do not carry over into the second round. For example, if a restaurant had five votes at the first round, but two votes in the second round, the restaurant will only have two votes at the end. This is becauses users can change their minds in the second round, so we decided it was probably better to reset the number of swipes each restaurant has.

Note that you can technically play by yourself, so the app can have any number of users. If none of the restaurants get any right-swipes, then the game ends with a simple message stating there was no concensus on a restaurant. We chose to do this because it is a pretty rare case. It would also be better to inform the users that no one liked any restaurant, rather than choosing one for them. Finally, a user can only swipe once per restaurant. Otherwise, it would obviously skew the voting system.
